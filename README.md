    boolean isCompleteWord;
}
```

#### 4.2.1. Validation

> Don't look up each prefix from the root
> Build on the past calls by returning node reference
> keeping state witin a tree

### 4.3. Greedy Algorithms

[Greedy for Beginners](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/669996/Greedy-for-Beginners-Problems-or-Sample-solutions)
Greedy Algorithms only apply to problems whose global optimal solution relies on its local optimal solutions.
The way to Think is, is my current step able to bring me closer to the answer for sure?

+ [Maximum NUmber of Events that can attend](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/)

Each day I try to grab / take more, but I do have my own code: the grabing / taking should sustain me as long as possible. Therefore I only grab the one that ends first, and save the ones that ends later.

### 4.4. Dynamic Programming

_Interesting Summary by **aatalyk** from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns)_
_Doing Topological Sort for a group of subproblems dependency DAG_

+ Merging Intervals [DONE]
+ Minimum (Maximum) Path to Reach a Target
+ Distinct Ways
+ DP on Strings [DONE]
+ Decision Making [DONE]

Top-Down approach and bottom up approach.

#### 4.4.1. Memoization Pattern

It always works if you cache your result.

> if you solve the subproblem, note down the answer
> DP ~=~ recursion + memoization.
> O(T) = number of subtimes * time per subproblem
> Don't count recursion, because only need to count once

#### 4.4.2. Shortest Path

_for memoization to work, you need **ACYCLIC GRAPH**_
_Else you will run into infinite loop_

To make a Cyclic Graph Acyclic:

> + given search space, v
> + make k copies of (based on k in degrees);
> + for v edges
> + search space v * k
> Need to refer to [bellman-ford algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/)

#### 4.4.3. Merge Interval Patterns

```java
for (int win = 1; win < length; win++){
    for (int i = 0; i < length - win; i++){
        j = i + win;
        for (int k = i; k < j ; k++){
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + func(nums[i], nums[k], nums[j]));
        }
    }

#### 4.4.7. Kadane's Algorithm

```
// Given an input array of numbers "nums",
best = negative infinity
current = 0
for num in nums:
    current = Max(current + num, num)
    best = Max(best, current)
return best

```

### 4.5. Breadth First Search & Depth First Search

> Take note there are something called the Bi-directional search.

#### 4.5.1. LeetCoe OpenLock Example

```java
    public int openLock(String[] deadends, String target){
        Set<String> end = new HashSet();
        Set<String> begin = new HashSet();
        Set<String> deads = new HashSet();
        for (String s : deadends){
            deads.add(s);
        }
        if (deads.contains("0000")) return -1;
        begin.add("0000");
        end.add(target);
        int level = 0;
        while(!begin.isEmpty() && !end.isEmpty()){
            if (begin.size() < end.size()){
                Set<String> temp = begin;
                begin = end;
                end = temp;
            }
            Set<String> curLevel = new HashSet<>();
            for (String s : begin){

                if (deads.contains(s)){
                    continue;
                }
                deads.add(s);
                char[] curArr = s.toCharArray();
                for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
                    String s1 = getString(curArr, i, 1);
                    String s2 = getString(curArr, i, -1);
                    if (end.contains(s1)){
                        return level + 1;
                    }
                    if (end.contains(s2)){
                        return level + 1;
                    }
                    if (!deads.contains(s1)){
                        curLevel.add(s1);
                    }
                    if (!deads.contains(s2)){
                        curLevel.add(s2);
                    }
                }
            }
            begin = curLevel;
            level++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
```

_idea is that b^(d/2) + b^(d/2) is much less than b^d. b is branch factor, d is depth._

#### 4.5.2. Depth First Search

``` java
// Spiral DFS backtracking
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
    int nx = x + dirs[dir][0];
    int ny = y + dirs[dir][1];
    if (!visited.contains(new Pair(nx, ny)) && robot.move()){
        clean(robot, dir, nx, ny);
    }
    dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
    robot.turnRight();
}

```

### 4.6. TopLogical Sort

**For DAG Only**
**No vertex shall come after the one it is pointing to**
**implemented by Stack and Set**

+ [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)
+ [Parallel Courses](https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses/) very interesting, look at solution, have all the approaches.
+ [Alien Dictionary]()


### 4.7. Minimax (Gaming and Artificial Intelligence)

Good Place to Start
+ <https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/minimax-algorithm-alpha-beta-pruning/>

```python
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer)
            if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node
                   return the utility of the node

            if maximizingPlayer
                   bestValue := ??
            for each child of node
                   v := minimax(child, depth ? 1, FALSE)
                   bestValue := max(bestValue, v)
            return bestValue  

            else (* minimizing player *)
                   bestValue := +?
                   for each child of node
                          v := minimax(child, depth ? 1, TRUE)
                          bestValue := min(bestValue, v)
                   return bestValue
```
*min max sometimes can be dp too*
*here is an example:*
+ [LC1690 Stone Game VII](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vii/submissions/)

*sometimes DP reminds me of the method of deduction, work backwards, ask your self, what if there are only 2 items*
*start from the simplest scenario and build from there, and try to come up with a transition function*


### 4.8. Bitwise Manipulation

> use ^ for XOR 10 ^ 0 = 10, 10 ^ 10 = 1
> & bitwise and, ~ bitwise not

### 4.9. Tortoise and Hare problems

slow and fast pointer problem
> beware of the difference between array and linkedlist

```java
    // arrays
    slow = nums[slow];
    fast = nums[nums[fast]];
    // linkedlist
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
```

### 4.10. Union Find - Disjointed Union Set

#### 4.10.1. Find and Union

Find will return to root.
Path compression and Union by rank.

Find: O(a(n)) ~= O(1)
Union: O(a(n)) ~= O(1)
Space: O(n)

#### 4.10.2. Template

[implementation1](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61bs02/hw/pj3/set/DisjointSets.java)

        array = new int[numElements];
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
            array[i] = -1;
        }

_Minimum Spanning Tree_ (Kruskal Algorithm)

A minimum spanning tree is a special kind of tree that minimizes the lengths (or “weights”) of the edges of the tree. An example is a cable company wanting to lay line to multiple neighborhoods; by minimizing the amount of cable laid, the cable company will save money.

**Questions**

[LC 307. Range Sum Query - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/)

> pay attention to how size of a segment tree is calculated, and how close it resembles merge-sort

```java
int height = (int)Math.ceil(Math.log(n) / Math.log(2));
int size = 2 * (int)Math.pow(2, height) - 1;
int[] tree = new int[size];

// buildTree(0, 0, n - 1, A)
public void buildTree(int treeIndex, int lo, int hi, int[] A)){
    if (lo == hi){
        tree[treeIndex] = A[lo];
        return;
    }
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    buildTree(2 * treeIndex + 1, lo, mid, A);
    buildTree(2 * treeIndex + 2, mid + 1, hi, A);
    tree[treeIndex] = tree[treeIndex * 2 + 1] + tree[treeIndex * 2 + 2];
}

// updateTree(0, 0, n - 1, target, val)
public void updateTree(int treeIndex, int lo, int hi, int target, int val){
    if (lo == hi){
        tree[treeIndex] = val;
        return;
    }
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo)/2;
    if (target <= mid){
        updateTree(treeIndex * 2 + 1, lo, mid, target, val);
    } else if  {
        updateTree(treeIndex * 2 + 2, mid + 1, hi, target, val);
    }
    tree[treeIndex] = tree[treeIndex * 2 + 1] + tree[treeIndex * 2 + 2]
}

public int queryTree(int treeIndex, int lo, int hi, int left, int right){
    if (left > hi || right < lo) return 0;
    if (lo >= left && hi <= right) return tree[treeIndex];
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

    int left = queryTree(treeIndex * 2 + 1, lo, mid, left, right);
    int right = queryTree(treeIndex * 2 + 2, mid + 1, hi, left, right);

    return left + right;
}
