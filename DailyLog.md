- DeleteProduct.java, line 169 forceDeleteProduct, need to use Tranctional annotations, in case we have a problem, we can roll back. 
- ProductUpdater.java, line 74, it is best to also put transaction annotations at service level, so that if this unit of work logic gets exceptions (updateProduct method), our database gets rolled back.
- ParseSavedConfig,.java: Line 155 should change to 
  List<String> sortedKeys = new ArrayList<>(customerNames.keySet());
- PRoductUnicity.java, Line 26, use booleanValue() to simplify code
- ProductUnicity.java, Line 51, use lamda expression, and Math.max to simplify the code. 
- ProductUnicity.java, line 84 to 94, refactor into else if
- ProductUnicity.java, method getAllRevisionsFromPARefOrCIRef, we can combine some of the if else, using else if
